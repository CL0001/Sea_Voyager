# Sea_Voyager
My initial attempt at creating, documenting, and collaborating with others to develop a game.

## About
Sea Voyager aims to be a relaxing boat game with a top-down 2.5D click-to-move perspective.

### Current Stage
Sea Voyager is currently in the **Early Alpha stage**.
#### Stages
1. **Alpha** - Focus on core gameplay mechanics, performance optimization, and bug fixing.
2. **Beta** - Introduce more content, polish existing features, and gather feedback from a wider audience.
3. **Release** - Launch the game with a stable and feature-rich experience, followed by post-launch support and updates based on community feedback.

### Planned Features
Here's a glimpse of what's to come in future updates:
- Advanced Ship Abilities: Expand the ship selection to include more cosmetic changes and functionality enhancements.
- Dynamic World Events: Introduce dynamic events such as storms, sea monsters, and rival pirate encounters to make the world feel more alive and unpredictable.
